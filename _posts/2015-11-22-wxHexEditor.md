title: wxHexEditor | x86 ASM
---

I recently came across Dennis Yurichev's [reverse engineering challenges](http://challenges.re/).  
After starting to delve into some, I began the tools one needs to "check under the hood" of 
some the challenges that I have seen today.   More than that, I haved had a little experience with ARM
assembly -- but realized that I have not speant nearly enough time checking out x86.

I stockpiled some notes on tools that could be beneficial; so I dialed them up and began to take a look
through them to see what was useful.

* Assemblers/Compilers
* Disassemblers/Decompilers
* Debuggers
* Hex Editors
