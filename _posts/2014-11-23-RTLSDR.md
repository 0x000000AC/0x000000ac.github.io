I was originally interested in RTLSDR after seeing ![Melissa Elliott's]({{ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N1C3WB8c0o }}) Defcon 21 discussion on "Exploring the Noise Floor." I decided to pick up the RTLSDR device she talked about here[2] .

After I got the fc0013b[3] , I talked with some friends in RF communications to see what may be the best "wide-net" antenna. They directed me to this blog[4] which has a handy program to calculate the physical size of a discone based on the lowest input frequency (A note to the would be builder: grows QUICK based on the lower start frequency. I found 80 MHz OK based on my needs, YMMD).

Anyway, here [5] is my Imgur album of interesting signals (including POCSAG) and parts of my discone build. I got signals in the 80 - 950 MZh range.

Here[6] is a video at about 419 MHz that I was hoping you could identify.

Here[7] is a video of me hitting my car key fob in close proximity.
