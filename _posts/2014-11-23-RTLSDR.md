title: Quick and Dirty Discon Antenna with RTLSDR
category: RTLSDR
---

I was originally interested in RTLSDR after seeing [Melissa Elliott's Defcon 21 discussion on "Exploring the Noise Floor."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N1C3WB8c0o)


I decided to pick up the RTLSDR device she talked about [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N1C3WB8c0o#t=345).

After I got the [fc0013b](http://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-fc0013b-e4000.html), I talked with some friends in RF communications to see what may be the best "wide-net" antenna. They directed me to this [blog](http://helix.air.net.au/index.php/d-i-y-discone-for-rtlsdr/) which has a handy program to calculate the physical size of a discone based on the lowest input frequency (A note to the would be builder: grows QUICK based on the lower start frequency. I found 80 MHz OK based on my needs, YMMD).

Anyway, [here](http://imgur.com/a/7ph56) is my Imgur album of interesting signals (including POCSAG) and parts of my discone build. I got signals in the 80 - 950 MZh range.

[Here](https://vid.me/nTm)is a video at about 419 MHz that I believe to be packet radio.

[Here](https://vid.me/6Ww)is a video of me hitting my car key fob in close proximity.
